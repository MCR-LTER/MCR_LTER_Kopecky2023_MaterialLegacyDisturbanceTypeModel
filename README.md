# Material-legacy-disturbance-type-model
Theoretical model of coral reef recovery dynamics following different types, severities, and frequencies of disturbances.

## Files:
All R code used to construct the model and create figures 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the manuscript "Material legacies can degrade resilience: Structure-retaining disturbances promote regime shifts on coral reefs" can be found in the markdown file titled "Material legacies model_April 2022". Matlab code used to create figure 3 can be found in the file "Matlab_code.ml".
